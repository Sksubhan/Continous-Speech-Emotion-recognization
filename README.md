# Continous-Speech-Emotion-recognization
Our Project Predicts the emotions of a speaker in an audio file. We used machine learning models and concepts like Convenutional Neural Networks and Support Vector Machines to analyze and give score to each emotion . We took totally eight emotions in this model. This project predicts different emotions of a speaker and it sorts these emotions from maximum to minimum . You can check this repository and follow the code for more information.
